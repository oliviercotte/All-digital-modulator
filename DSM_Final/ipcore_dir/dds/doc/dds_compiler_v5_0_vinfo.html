  LogiCORE IP DDS Compiler.

2. DEVICE SUPPORT 

  2.1. ISE

    The following device families are supported by the core for this release:

    All Series 7 devices
    All Virtex-6 devices
    All Spartan-6 devices


3. NEW FEATURE HISTORY

  3.1 ISE
 
  v5.0
    - Ongoing new device support.
    - AXI4 Stream interfaces replace old pinout

  v4.0 
    - Note: DDS Compiler version 4.0 is not bit-accurate with respect to version 3.0
      and earlier. In particular, first order Taylor Series Correction table entries
      have been optimized to improve overall accuracy. Extended range of DDS with no
      noise shaping may reduce DATA width requirements. The update function will aim
      to adjust Frequency Resolution to maintain the phase width and associated DATA
      width.  Note that this may result in the specified Frequency Resolution parameter
      changing. However, as phase width is maintained, this will not affect
      the actual resolution of frequency or phase values. Also, there have been
      changes to latency, in particular to accommodate the new dynamic phase
      increment and phase offset options. Accumulator Latency has been removed
      and is assumed to be One.


4. RESOLVED ISSUES 

  4.1 ISE

    - N/A


5. KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS 

  The following are known issues for this core at time of release:

  5.1 ISE
    1. TLAST may be incorrectly asserted at power-up or after a reset for the following core configuration:
       Parts Present = DDS (both phase generator and SIN/COS LUT present)
       Channels = 2
       Phase Increment = Fixed
       Phase Offset = None or Fixed
       Output TLAST = Vector Framing
       - Workaround:
         Set M_DATA and/or M_PHASE TUSER setting to "Channel ID" or "User Field and Channel ID" (as appropriate). 
         The LSB of the TUSER output will be asserted to indicate the last (second) channel. 
         This bit may then be passed to downstream modules in place of the TLAST output.
       - CR 574542
       - AR 42351

    2. Any data input to the core in the clock cycle following the de-assertion will be dropped. 
       - Workaround is to ensure TVALID is not asserted to either input channel on the clock cycle immediately 
         following aresetn deassertion.
       - CR 593280
       - AR 40551 

    3. It is possible for the configuration channel in multichannel mode to lock up and deassert
       tready in the context of an ACLKEN signal with fixed mark/space ratio, e.g. 1 in 2 clock 
       cycles.
       - Workaround is either not to use ACLKEN, which is not recommended for AXI operation, or
         to use streaming mode input instead.
       - CR 653218

    4. The demonstration testbench may fail with syntax errors due to either an extraneous comma in the
       port map of the design under test or of a mismatch of ports to the design under test. 
       - Workaround is to hand edit the demonstration testbench.
       - CR 678866
       - AR 51915
